Types of Constructors :
1. Default or Parameter Less Constructor
2. Parameterized Constructor
3. Copy Constructor
4. Static Constructor

1. Default or Parameter Less Constructor ::
-If a constructor method doesn't take any parameters then we call
that as default or parameter less. These constructors can be defined
by a programmer explicitly or else will be default implicitly
provided there is no explicit constructor under the class

2. Parameterized Constructor :::
If a constructor method is defined with out any parameters we call
that as parameterized constructor and these constructors can be
defined by the programmers only but never can be defined implicitly.

3. Copy Constructor :::
If we want to create multiple instances with the same values then we
use these copy constructors, in a copy constructor the constructor
takes the same class as a parameter to it.

4 . Static Constructor :::
If a constructor is explicitly declared by using className only we
call that as Static Constructor. All the constructors we have defined
till now are non-static or instance constructors.

4a. If a class contains any static variables then only implicit static constructors will be present or else we need to define them explicitly
   whereas non-static constructors will be implicitly defined in every class (except static class) provided we did not define them explicitly.

4b. Static constructor are responsible in initializing static variables and these constructors are never called explicitly 
   they are implicitly called and more over these constructor are first to execute under any class.

4c. Static constructors can't be parameterized so overloading of static constructors is not possible.
